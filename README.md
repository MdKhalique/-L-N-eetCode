# -L-N-eetCode
A repo to document my understanding of programming problems - how to solve them and the logic behind the solution(s)

Feel free to browse and critique my work - discussions are welcome. 
This is a response to some classes I've taken and I hope to keep developing my problem solving skills and pattern recognition.
